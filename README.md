# MBC19_Budget-Tracker

Monash Bootcamp Assignement 19 - PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

### About this project

Monash Bootcamp starter code was enhanced to create this application.

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important.

This application allows for offline access and functionality by providing users with capability to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection when travelling. If transactions are entered offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
